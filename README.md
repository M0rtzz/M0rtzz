# <Hello>你好👋, &nbsp;I'm M0rtzz</Hello>

I'm an undergraduate student with a passion for coding from ZZU. I also enjoy practicing dhyana 🧘🏻‍♂️ and going hiking 🚶🏻‍♂️, but I steer clear of dangerous activities. I post blogs on [m0rtzz.com](https://www.m0rtzz.com).

During my leisure hours, I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to acquiring and honing computer skills while making diligent attempts at crafting English blogs. My overarching objective is to elevate my language proficiency to effortlessly comprehend advanced academic papers in English as I pursue further studies.

More information about me can be found on my website at [m0rtzz.com/resume](https://www.m0rtzz.com/resume).
