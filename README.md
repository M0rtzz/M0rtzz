# <Hello>你好👋, &nbsp;I'm M0rtzz</Hello>

I'm a student from ZZU, with a love for writing code. I post blogs on [m0rtzz.com](https://m0rtzz.com).

In my spare time, I learn `linux`. I try to write some English posts to level up my English, with the aim to work remotely in the future.

I also like dhyana 🧘🏻‍♂️ and hiking 🚶🏻‍♂️, but I don't do risky tricks.
