# <Hello>你好👋, &nbsp;I'm M0rtzz</Hello>

I'm an undergraduate student from ZZU, with a love for writing code. I post blogs on [m0rtzz.com](https://www.m0rtzz.com).

During my leisure hours, I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to acquiring and honing computer skills while simultaneously making diligent attempts at crafting English blogs, all with the overarching objective of elevating my language proficiency to effortlessly comprehend advanced academic texts in English, as I embark on my pursuit of graduate studies.

I also like dhyana 🧘🏻‍♂️ and hiking 🚶🏻‍♂️, but I don't do risky tricks.

More information about me can be found on my website at [m0rtzz.com/resume](https://www.m0rtzz.com/resume).
